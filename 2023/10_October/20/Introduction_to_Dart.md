## üåü Introduction to Dart

### What is Dart?
Dart is a modern programming language developed by Google. In the official website it's said that "Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform". It's designed for ease of use, strong support for modern web workflows, and simple syntax. Notably, Dart compiles to native code for high-performance execution on various platforms. Dart can be used for various kinds of programming including mobile, desktop, server, and web development.

### Dart vs Other Languages
- **JavaScript**: Dart offers better performance and a stronger type system.
- **TypeScript**: While similar to TypeScript, Dart doesn't require a separate compiler and has a different syntax and standard library.
- **Java**: Dart is more lightweight and allows for more flexible programming paradigms.
